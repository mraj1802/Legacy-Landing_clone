          When a person dies, their assets may need to go through the probate
          process. Probate is a court proceeding that allows a personal
          representative, also known as an executor or administrator, to settle
          the final debts of the decedent and distribute money or assets to the
          decedent&lsquo;s heirs or legatees. If there were assets that were
          named beneficiaries or joint owners, then those assets typically stay
          out of probate.

          If a person dies intestate, it means they died without a will. If this
          happens, many states will require probate to administer the
          decedent&lsquo;s assets. For intestate estates, an administrator has
          to be appointed by a court. An administrator is similar to an
          executor, but the difference is that an executor is associated with a
          will. Oftentimes an administrator may be a spouse, child, parent, or
          the decedent&lsquo;s closest living relative.

        >
          When a person dies without a will, the court usually requires a bond
          on the estate. A bond is very similar to an insurance policy. The
          purpose of the bond is to provide financial protection for the estate
          from the administrator. A bond is not refundable and the cost of the
          bond will be based on the value of the estate.

          mt={2}
        >
          In probate, there are supervised and unsupervised estates. If an
          estate is supervised, it requires the administrator to get court
          permission for each event in the probate process. If an estate is
          unsupervised, the administrator can take most steps without getting
          permission from the court.

          Each jurisdiction has its own “claims period” in which creditors can
          file claims against the estate for any debts that the decedent had.
          Once the claims period has passed and all debts have been paid, the
          administrator will be able to distribute the probate estate&lsquo;s
          remaining assets by the terms of the inheritance laws of the
          jurisdiction (often called <b>intestate succession</b> or{" "}
          <b>rules of descent and distribution)</b>.

          If a person dies testate, it means they died with a will. The executor
          will locate the original will and should file the will in the county
          that the decedent was a resident of when they died. Many jurisdictions
          require the executor to file the original will (not a copy of the
          original) because there may be a presumption that the decedent revoked
          the original will if it cannot be located.

          When the executor petitions the court to begin the probate process,
          the executor may still need to get a bond to protect the financial
          interest of the estate. Each court and jurisdiction has different
          rules regarding bonds. Sometimes the last will and testament can
          “waive” or avoid bond, but other times the court may still require it.
          Some testate estates may also have to be supervised, but this
          typically happens when there are family disputes about the
          executor&lsquo;s estate.

          Once the court approves the executor&lsquo;s appointment, the executor
          will be able to manage claims of the estate that are filed within the
          creditor claims period. After the claims are paid, the executor will
          either liquidate the remaining assets or distribute them to the
          beneficiaries of the will.

          Personal property can be tangible or intangible. Personal property is
          not real estate. When a person or entity owns intangible personal
          property, such as bank or investment accounts, they typically
          establish their ownership by associating their name and tax
          identification number with the property. When a tangible property is
          acquired, ownership can vary depending on the item. Examples of
          tangible items are cars, jewelry, luxury items, etc.

          If you own property in your name individually, then you are the sole
          owner of that property. Your social security number may be used to
          establish ownership of many of your intangible assets, such as bank
          accounts or investment accounts. Many intangible assets allow the
          owner to designate beneficiaries to them. If you do not designate a
          beneficiary to your intangible personal property, then your property
          will be part of your probate estate when you pass away. Your property
          will be distributed by the terms of your will or through your

          For assets that are tangible, your jurisdiction&lsquo;s regulatory

          Joint ownership is similar to sole ownership, except there is more
          than one owner tied to your personal property. Joint ownership of
          intangible assets typically allows the surviving joint owner (the
          person who is last to die) to have 100% ownership rights to the
          property and when they pass away, the property will belong to their
          estate or go to their designated beneficiaries. Depending on the
          asset, a joint owner may be an individual, a corporation, or a trust.

          Multiple owners can own items of tangible personal property. Cars are

          they die, the asset will belong to their estate. Accordingly, the
          surviving owner may designate beneficiaries to the asset through their
          will or trust.

          Trusts can own most tangible and intangible personal assets. When a

          number) may be used to acquire the asset. Many revocable living trusts

          When people* own real estate as tenants in common, each owner has

          When two or more people own real estate as joint tenants, typically
          they will have a right of survivorship. In other words, if one of the
          joint tenants dies, the surviving joint tenants will own the property.
          Each joint tenant has a 100% claim (or an undivided right) to their
          ownership interest and possession of the real property. Joint tenants
          will become joint tenants of the real property at the same time and by
          the same document.

          When two people own real property as tenants in the entirety, they
          meet all of the requirements of a joint tenancy, and, additionally,
          they must be married. Upon the first spouse&lsquo;s death, the
          surviving spouse will be the sole owner of the property.
