In 2021, NFTs were expanding like the petals of young flowers. They significantly had an impact on the way we gaze at digital art. In 2022, NFTs spread like wildfire across the globe, and various popular collections associated with celebrities like Bored Ape Yacht Club & CryptoPunks have set the trends at all-time highs.

Inside news revealed that many celebrities burned hundreds of thousands of dollars and even millions on NFTs to stir things up and polish the headlines. Many crypto analysts and experts anticipated that the hype would be sunk soon; however, NFTs have outflanked crypto heading into mid-2022 & celebrities owning non-fungible tokens, if they didn't sell, will be up on their buy.

In the last few months, there has been a torrent of tweets from many celebrities reporting ownership of their digital art. Some have even entered the NFT space and upheld collections of NFTs, or some took a step to a new level, launching their own celebrity NFT platforms.

Not only this, many celebrities have initiated intelligent contracts with the help of blockchain, enabling them to own their art in their genre, tokenizing their movies, music, photographs, music, music, ticket access to events, and even their tweets.

## SIUUU; CR7 & Binance NFT shake hand

We all know what CR7 stands for. Yes, the famous Cristiano Ronaldo. One of the few billionaires in the sports industry, SIUUU. The five-time Ballon D’or winner and one of the greatest have joined forces with Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volumes.

The multi-year partnership with Portuguese footballing legend will offer football fans an opportunity to claim "a famous piece of sports history." The show doesn’t end here; according to various official reports, it will be launched with a series of NFT collections exclusively on Binance.

The football genius also stated;
**“Today we are going to change the NFT game and take football to the next level,”**

Binance is quite possibly the crypto's most extensive ecosystem; its significant parts incorporate the Binance centralized trade and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). BSC is the second most running blockchain second to Ethereum, taking the hauls at 407 unique protocols and a whopping $5.92 billion of significant worth locked and loaded. Yes, it’s that big.

Adding another spoon of sugar, the collection will initiate its launch later this year (2022), featuring state-ofthe-art designs in collaboration with CR7.

**A message for CR7 fans;**

“My relationship with the fans is significant to me, so the idea of bringing unprecedented experiences and access through this NFT platform is something I wanted to be a part of,” said Ronaldo. “I know the fans will enjoy the collection as much as I do.”

## Is Binance being Desperate?

However, with these galvanic benchmarks, Binance has battled long enough to foster a flourishing local NFT environment. The decentralized Binance exchange, Pancakeswap, a driving convention, marks its place at 20th compared to NFT marketplaces. The aggregated trading volume is only $79million. There are more giant sharks already ruling this kingdom of NFTs, looks are & Opensea, having $31.24 billion and $23.23 billion, respectively.

Yes, it can be seen as a desperate move from Binance with CR7 in this manner, as an attempt to bring value to Binance Smart Chain and get a piece of the pie in expanding the NFTs blockchain market.

According Binance CEO, **_Changpeng Zhao_**, stated
**_“Now, we start.”_**
Puff, at least they know it’s now or never.

## Conclusão

The addiction to NFTs is increasing day by day. It’s like a virus that has penetrated every industry, and there is no stopping it. Celebrities, athletes, and billionaires are now more into digital art than “Mona Lisa” or “the starry night.”

From sports stars like Colin Kaepernick to CR7, musicians and DJs like Snoop Dog and Marshmello, and actresses like Gwyneth Paltrow, they are all already in, and the list continues.

Assuming that there's one thing we've gained from the recent years, it seems the NFT train won't stop at any point shortly. NFTs have altered how we gaze at digital art and, more significantly, the ownership because of blockchain tech. This has allowed artists to launch interesting NFT projects more often.

So it only states one thing, NFTs will be shining like stars in the future. Maybe for a few of those out there, it’s just another investment category to target, but NFTs could soon change the whole scenario of how we come in contact and consume media these days.

Are your NFTs precious enough? Save them before it’s too late. **_Learn more_**

All in all, it’s an early Christmas gift for all football fans around the globe. NFT, football, and Cristiano Ronaldo fans, this is only the beginning of what’s to come.
