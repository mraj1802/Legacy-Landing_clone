Assets? Something every single person on this entire planet owns. For person "X" it's a bike, for "Y" it's a Lamborghini, and for "Z" it's a house. Our time, hard work, passion, and decisions drive our lives in building the direction of our assets. For instance, the human body itself is an asset. Yes, according to TIMES, your body worth’s up to $45million.

The ability to touch, feel, smell, to see in the physical world can be put in the class of physical assets. Walking in a park on a Sunday morning, you smell something; a citric breeze slips under your nose. Your memory cells activate, start to shape up the image in the back of your head, and before even turning towards it, you know what it is, Oranges. It is a wholesome process to be able to feel and sense things.

We all know the smell of our parent's house in which we spent our childhood, the scent of bricks and soil after the rain. It may have wrinkled but never faded away. Because of all this, we humans tend to perceive the emotional and monetary value at different edges of our minds. Taking into consideration that owning a house comes twofold. First is the emotional weight of a place to raise a family, enabling shelter from the environment.

The second fold is monetary value, enabling a rise in profit in areas of development and progress. Since the creation of humankind, a straightforward way of developing a generational legacy was land ownership. So one way to define physical assets is "land." On the contrary, it doesn't mean the boundaries of physical assets are bound by land; a "truck," for instance, inherit in the same class. A farm is an asset used to grow crops and food to be sold in the market. Yes, assets links with other investments, giving birth to a chain of assets, i.e., oil fields, mines, corporate offices, sea beds, etc.

## Adios to Zero & 1’s

The place is getting exhausted as developers, and associated actors have manipulated all land assets. But where one door shuts, another opens digital economies.
This new era has revolutionized the meaning of assets. Even using blockchain, smart contracts can easily encode physical assets on the blockchain ledger itself. So these days' money and value come via social technologies raising the true meaning of one's saying:

Who thought in the 90s that we may soon have the option to own intangibles in much the same way we possess objects we can touch

## Revolution or Much More?

The opportunities are limitless and cost-effective, considering transferring assets, legal fees, top-notch security, fast transactions, and across-the-seas market exposure are among the extraordinary benefits of having digital assets in your pocket. Yes, it's easy to carry a $billion in your pocket rather than have a billion bricks these days.

Social media accounts, NFTs, Cryptocurrencies, online shares, websites, and other digital assets are the new “Gold” in town. These assets not only entered mainstream finance but are way ahead when it comes to technology in their sight. Starting from the development of bitcoin in 2009, the ecosystem of these assets has developed savagely with many tokens/assets available to you today, including Digital Art (NFTs), Social Media Accounts, USDT, ETH, BTC, and significantly more.

Having dinner and watching baseball with my family, I received a text from my lawyer about a massive loss in my business. Unfortunately, the estimated time for recovery is beyond the reach of my pockets. Thousands of scenarios are ringing inside my head: selling the house, cars, other assets, and much more. But once I sell it, I will not get it back, and the ownership is lost.

Smart contracts on blockchain have not only digitized your every transaction but allowing you to take control of conditions of ownership associated with your digital property. It not only makes the license permanent, but once you sell it to a third party and the third party to a fourth, the cycle continues. You get a cut on every transaction, per the condition you enabled in your smart contract. Likewise, smartphones application on Apple and Google play store allows you to earn a tremendous amount of money via ads, downloads, etc. It's like having rent from your digital home with a minimal cost of renovation.

Be that as it may, digital plays with different rules. Surprisingly, however, these new tech innovations and storage have opened up various gateways for digital creators, which segregate the market of earning a decent amount of money via these channels. Since digital assets can be replicated flawlessly without exertion, fakes exclusively cannot be quickly developed. In all respects, they are unclear from the originals.

## Eye of Thoughts

All in all, the protection and security of physical assets are primarily internal. Saying this doesn't imply that outside parties are not a danger to you or your assets since they are theft, for instance. Nonetheless, loss of physical assets frequently happens from the inside, the circle you are in. Besides, the method of protecting it is all the more effectively achieved internally, considering damaged goods, hardware, loss of land papers, and others.

The focus for digital assets is primarily external since most threats to digital content arise from adversaries outside your circle. Hacking of digital equipment, content, websites, or databases can be done from within, of course, but is primarily an external threat.
