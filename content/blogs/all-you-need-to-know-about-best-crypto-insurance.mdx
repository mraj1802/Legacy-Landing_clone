The crypto market was intentionally created to be unregulated, but that has not stopped people and corporations from demanding that the insurance industry offers solutions to cover the risks of their investments in digital assets. Suppose your company has opted to expand its portfolio and invest in crypto coins such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Monero. In that case, you should seriously consider obtaining the best crypto insurance for your company.

Because of the crypto market’s volatility, high-risk potential, uncontrolled nature, and short track record, several insurance providers are hesitant- or basically refuse- to offer crypto coverage to businesses and investors.

However, the insurance industry is gradually warming up to the crypto market, and few insurers are beginning to put crypto coverage into some company policies. Cryptocurrency insurance can be written into standalone plans or included in conventional business insurance policies, crime insurance, decentralized finance (DeFi) policies, or custody insurance.

##### Risks that Crypto Companies Face

Due to the nature of cryptocurrencies, most of the dangers these organizations face are tied to the internet environment. After all, cryptocurrency is a digital coin having no physical presence, and all investments, trading, and payments are carried out online.

As a result, the most significant risk for crypto firms is the potential of a cyberattack. Cybercriminals target crypto companies because cryptocurrencies can be incredibly difficult to track after funds are transferred.

Social engineering has also become common among hackers to get access to your network. They masquerade as a reputable and trustworthy source and dupe one of your employees into granting them access to your internal system or their accounts.

If you offer services concerning your business or work in the service industry, you are also in danger of making a professional mistake or omission. For instance, if you give advice to a client to invest crypto coins in an inappropriate fund, and they eventually lose money, they may sue you for improper advice.

While the above risks are not unique to crypto firms, their risk profile is exclusive because of their industry. When we relate this to the general unpredictability of the blockchain industry, we can perceive why insurance companies are still hesitant to insure these companies.

##### Crime Insurance

When an act of dishonesty, robbery, theft, cyber fraud, or destruction fraud occurs, Crime Insurance can cover a company’s claims for the loss of funds, inventories, securities, and other assets, including digital assets such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies.

##### General Business Insurance

Some typical business insurance policies, such as Errors & Omissions (E&O) and Directors & Officers (D&O)- often known as Professional Indemnity Insurance- can cover a company’s digital assets as well as cryptocurrency portfolio.

##### DeFi Insurance

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for crypto is also known as smart contract insurance, as it covers the failure of the smart contract. A crypto DeFi insurance policy helps ensure that the currency’s software is not hackable and that trading and other transactions are carried out in accordance with smart contract terms

## The Key Takeaway

Government agencies such as the Office of the Controller of the Currency (OCC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are working to improve regulatory clarity in the crypto market. Banks and various other financial organizations are increasingly adopting digital currencies as digital assets and making investments in the business.
