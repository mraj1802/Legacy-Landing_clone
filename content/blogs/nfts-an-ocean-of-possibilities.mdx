We all know that storms come with destruction, tearing and disrupting everything upside down. Storms in our digital world hit differently; instead of wiping things off, they lay the foundation of something big, something new, like Facebook and Snapchat.

The storm of NFTs hits our digital world in various dimensions. To some extent minimizing physical art while, on the other hand, blazing a path for blockchain and digital assets.

All in all, just like other digital revolutions, the NFT market has been bombarded with myths and facts that gave birth to so many things. Some optimists lead the way, some cynical close the gates, some pledge their souls for future investment, some are given deception that eventually will fade away one day, and some don’t understand what is going on.

## Untold Saga

It takes two to make a quarrel, so there is always some truth to be told for things that pop up out of the blue. The genre of NFTs took its first baby steps leaning on the shoulders of blockchain. The news on social channels about NFTs' awful effects on the climate is just as accurate as eggs came first before chickens, or is it the other way? Let’s not discuss that right now.

My point is that blockchain innovation had devastating effects before NFTs landed in the digital market. For ages, blockchain innovation has been enduring an onslaught for consuming high energy, especially to run Bitcoin. The whole organization has been consuming energy of 130TWh yearly, equivalent to 15 gigawatts. To put that in simple perspective, bitcoin's energy consumption was similar to some countries, and the emission of CO2 was near 41 metric tons, that’s a lot.

Nonetheless, that figure is lower than the outflows of the gold industry, frequently compared with digital currencies to invest money.

Just like fingerprints are not the same, each NFT is uniquely different. In other words, they do not all have a terrible effect on the climate. Contrarily it depends on the blockchain being utilized. Above all, the main pressing concern is mining, which runs on a proof of work basis that is more terrible for the climate regarding verification of stake and various other options.

Though more maintainable NFT systems are in progress, they will have less harmful effects on our climate. We should shed light on traditional currencies, which utilize tons of paper, machines that also run on energy, are less secure, not decentralized, and above all, authorities’ interference. Ethereum, one of the biggest blockchain platforms, expressed that the new version of Ethereum 2.0 will consume 99.95% less energy on its completion; that’s astonishing.

In any case, it should be kept in mind that any form of technology affects the climate, and blockchain lies in the same category. So we should consider that whatever happens to NFTs and blockchain, later on, some ecological effect is unavoidable.

## Useful or useless

If you subscribe to the theory that the only art of value is the art you can hold physically in your hand, listening to an album on Spotify or streaming a movie on NETFLIX may be considered just as useless as an NFT.

The craftsmanship of digital art has been around in the market for a long time, and currently, via NFTs, craftsmen have a new road through which they can sell and explore their art. So it’s simple: purchasing an NFT from a visual craftsman shouldn’t be a problem if you are ok with paying and watching a live concert. Both of them sell their art in different ways.

Marking their way in the gaming industry, NFTs make parts of gaming more valuable than they are currently. Yes, for instance, traditional gaming only allows the players to claim the game they buy, which is much more pierced when the remedy is monthly, see for yourself. Contrarily, NFT gaming will enable players to hold things beyond the game by putting whatever they want belonging to the NFTs category into their wallets.

The improvement is crystal clear for gamers, who frequently spend significant time styling them, building characters, training, and equipping them. Although certain players might never want to sell the characters they make over time, it would be jaw-dropping to realize that what you've invested all this energy into is worth something.

Not only will this, but ticketing can also probably be wiped out from the system only if we start using NFTs and just scan our way out. It’s a lot but it is possible.

## Reflection or Reality

Five fingers are not equal; the same goes for NFTs. Investing in NFTs is a wrong choice and a blanket statement that doesn't shed light on various NFTs. Let’s consider art for the investment prospect. On the other hand, we should note that buying NFT isn’t always associated with an investment; sometimes, individuals invest their money for emotions and sentimental value.

The evolution of the NFT market is tremendously fast, with buyers currently comprehending it to be speculative. Keeping that in view, the investment of NFTs in the art world is very much the same as trading art in the traditional world. If you belong to the art industry, you know art is considered a terrible venture just because it’s speculative. No piece is guaranteed to yield a profit.

The greater the risk, the greater the reward. That’s what NFT gaming is all about. It’s more like how you will build the characters and whether your character or items create some appeal in the gaming community. You hit the jackpot, and everyone will be grabbing hands on the stuff you have. Risky doesn’t mean it is terrible.

## Evil or Blessing

Carved in stone, many NFTs are tricks or scams, so it is essential to be sure that you research first when making your investments, like your research with your other assets. Exploiting unpracticed investors is the same old scheme. The key for those hoping to get into NFTs is understanding the task's legitimacy, which isn't simply all of the time. The NFT amateurs are less disposed to care for outstanding concerns, making them an obvious target for scams.

There will be con artists where there is an investment opportunity; that’s the short and long of it. In any case, it's wrong and foolish to stereotype the entire technology with a sweeping wiper and say NFTs are only a scam, nothing more and nothing less. Frequently people arrive at conclusions given poorly informed speculations from some random individual who is essentially following the story too.

## All or Nothing

A digital footprint that lasts forever. In the internet age, the system of NFTs allowed digital artists to sell their craftsmanship to anybody who wanted to buy it. Even though the picture can be duplicated and reused by others, an NFT offers somebody the distinction of knowing they "own" the first that last forever. The highest artwork sold in the NFT art world was for $69 million by an artist named “Beeple.” This created a boom in the market and drove every artist with an intelligent gadget and some skills of graphics to believe they could be the next “Beeple.”

Currently, NFTs can be considered a gold rush, getting amateurs and professionals on board and establishing a belief system that NFTs are valuable and will eventually make them rich. But it is what it is; any technological development in the past was seen as the future enabling success. Moreover, many people consider NFTs a method for bringing in cash, yet most NFTs sell at a modest rate considering the profit. It relies upon the NFT being referred to and the conviction of the seller and buyer in that NFT of its current and likely worth.

In any case, NFTs are less about making easy money and more about further developing and making things simpler for the future.
