"Let me know where you reside, and I can foresee how well you'll do in life."

Although I don’t have a crystal magic ball to see someone’s future, I do know beyond the shadow of a doubt that location is a fantastic indicator of one’s life or welfare would be. For sure, a child born in Somalia is supposed to live almost 20 years less than a child born in the US. Besides, this kid will procure a minimal part when earning, nearly 5-8% less, of what their American counterpart will procure. This inequality may sound alarming to many, but in the end, it is what it is, time for bed. zzz zzz

So here is a dirty secret:
I eat breakfast in bed EVERY MORNING. I mean, yeah, why not?

Toast in Toaster, Every Day and Night, Nice Lifestyle, and Yummy! It’s not like I have a kitchen, dining table, or even a couch to sit on and enjoy it the way it should be. I can afford an indulgent breakfast, and eating in bed is a treat I bestow on myself every morning. Sounds normal to many, right? 821 million people, 1 in 9, go to bed on empty stomachs every night. Such variations in pay and day-to-day living standards inside a country are disrupting. Many countries face an electricity crisis; take Boukombe, for example, nearly everybody is poor, and there is not a single home with electricity. Say goodbye to toasters, eh’?

All in all, the question is truly “why?”
Despite a solid push for the development plan backed with strong economic growth, why does spatial imbalance persist? We all know the political power lies in the top levels, flowing down like a fountain, blessing the ones who filled their buckets at the top and showering the leftovers standing below, hunting what’s left.

- But what if I tell you that the person living in Somalia can live a lifestyle the same as that in America?
- What if there is a digital road for everyone where any politicians and banks do not govern things?
- What if there is a platform where you can own assets without border restrictions?

Sounds so good to be true, right?
I welcome you to the **land of blockchain.**

## Crypto Clouds

Let’s have a mini-go round of our globe, from America to China, from Latin America to Europe, or from Asia to the North pole, and paying little heed to the whole political system, private enterprises have vanquished the world. The high development efficiency has indeed intended between 2003 & 2013; for instance, worldwide per capita pay multiplied. The outcome is simply that the world is getting sufficiently rich to care for everyone.

The boom of Microsoft to the reach of Facebook was no more than a digitized global revolution. Just like that, one of the greatest tech stories of 2017 was the blast of public awareness regarding digital currencies. In the land of blockchain, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg can be recognized as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These two currencies fueled the market and took other digital currencies to rocket prices.

Numerous pixels keep on mumbling rumors about whether these prices are just a fling, taking a toll whether these digital currencies proclaim the ascent with conventional standards of state-backed coins or the backend of this hype is the need to give liquidity to illegal businesses.

In any case, the frenzy clouds of bitcoin links with blockchain, a technology that underpins almost all digital currencies, is a much more universal-based innovation. Money holds the potential to bring a revolution that can reach far beyond the boundaries of currency markets.

The progressive nature of blockchain lies in its capacity to safely stock, track, divide and transfer money over the Internet with a blink of an eye. More or less, what the Internet was to virtual entertainment — the center empowering innovation — blockchain is the possibility of a natural sharing ecosystem.

## Time to shift

Change in a system doesn’t pop up overnight. It takes time, passion, ideas, dedication, and manpower. You slowly but surely get there.
The spark of blockchain ignited in the 90s, but our tech systems were not ready to implement such humongous structures. Just like that, what’s required is a system that guarantees that everybody can view themselves as a piece of the puzzle for the coming future, enabling them to take advantage of financial development just by being a part of the social group. Here is something: why not give a portion of everything to everybody within our society?

For instance, envision a system or society where the community claims 33% of its goods, laborers possess a third, and a third is owned by capital — so everybody has a portion of everything. Simply put, rather than reallocation, which is genuinely posted distribution, we ought to go for pre-distribution. This model would keep on cultivating the development process and venture while giving everybody a stake from here on out.

The above model directly links with a decentralized blockchain system, enabling cruise control over users’ assets with zero strings attached to banks or other governed organizations.

The buyer certainty is extensively higher among crypto owners than the average American who lies on traditional currencies, leading crypto owners to almost 19.7% higher all over the market. The crypto boom was not limited to particular regions and reached like a global firestorm. The disparity can be partially explained by the typical crypto owner being "bound to be richer and younger" than the regular U.S. grown-up. It points out where the new generation is heading, to the future, it seems.

This capacity makes blockchain a possibly strong catalyst for guaranteeing that everybody can possess a portion of financial goods.

As I mentioned earlier, it takes time to bring a change, and fortunately, we are living in that era. A ton needs to happen politically to make this work. In any case, by making it conceivable to understand the first idealistic commitments of the sharing economy, we would be empowering new merchandise in the economy to be partially possessed by each individual from the local area. Utilizing blockchain to assign such a circulated, democratic-based ownership structure could give everybody a stake in our future that seems robotic rather than extending imbalance and political struggle.
