In our current era, words wear off that are etched on our tombstones but leaving a digitized mark is another story. We all die. The goal isn't to live forever; the goal is to create something meaningful that will. For the world, that's Immortality. Motivation for anything is an internal process, though creating a "will" is eternal. Whether we define it as a drive or a need, motivation is a condition inside us that desires a change that lasts a lifetime and more, either in the self or the environment. Our motivation in developing Suite Life is centered around the issues people have faced since the start of the human race.

## In a world full of misfortunes, create an everlasting fortune.

Creating a "will" and declaring your assets after death is stressful. Most of the time, the wills have not been properly executed. Solicitors and professional will writers can make errors causing the choice to be invalid. Falling word errors or manipulating beneficiaries has always been in the box.

Imposters in digital assets distribution have been in the news, demanding rights to NFTs, crypto coins, and social platforms. **_Hectic, isn't it?_**

We at Legacy suite developed a “Suite Life” mantra, which is not about when, but rather "it's all about now." Therefore we not only respect your traditional values, but we incorporate your digital, physical, social, and blockchain assets in one place.

## From next-generation to now: Digital assets

The escalation of digital assets has boosted beyond the limits of the sky, launching a degree of market revenue that is adequate to lure strategies at most financial institutions and different organizations.

If we keep a close eye on current digital assets, it's not just about the impact. Still, it's how they are revolutionizing capital markets and forcing changes to the global financial ecosystem. Especially blockchain, a distributed ledger technology (DLT) for digital assets to manage, is likewise building incredible momentum, inspiring organizations with the capacity to reevaluate how they conduct business.

Cryptocurrencies roughly quadrupled in value from the end of 2020 to late 2021, when the market was worth more than $3 trillion. **_Yes, it is that big._**

While fueling ourselves from bites of social media, few of us may notice the content we create to build our social media presence. From videos and images to the content generated from users that companies sponsor, the rate at which we feed our digital identities daily will not slow down. Each piece of content on our social media platforms is cooking up digital meals for the digital footprints we leave behind.

Yet our identities are stranded once our second life comes calling, "Death in the Digital World." The ghosts of lost loved ones have always haunted us, but the undefined role of the dead, the dying, and the grieving in the digital world is an ever-evolving cultural haunting.

At Legacy Suite, we value your traditions and recognize the struggles you endured digitally and physically to amass your property. We combat the technological entanglements to ensure that your “Suite Life’ encompasses all your views, cultural habitats, and intentions. We are allowing you to capture moments and preserve them in an eternal, everlasting digitized world. Providing a home for all your favorite photos will ensure that these precious moments and memories never vanish with time. Yes, we make sure of it.

The challenges for the existing legal framework, complicated by the digital revolution, entail a growing need to tackle the complexity of inheritance law in a digitized world. So, wipe your sweat. Suite Life accommodates a suitable and secure solution for your families, friends, or loved ones to gain access to and execute your wishes associated with your NonFungible tokens (NFTs), stablecoins, cryptocurrencies, social media accounts, digital files, physical and other valuable assets at the time of your earthly demise. **_Yes, this is all possible._**

We believe keeping things secure and stored for your “Suite Life" is a gift for which your heirs will be so grateful and one more reason for them to sing your praises!

Handling matters to government authorities to decide which family members are eligible for a share of your assets disrupts not only your legacy but the true essence and meaning of relations. So in a world loaded with vulnerability, distress, and isolation, a gift of legacy can be one of the most critical and enduring commitments. It not only sets a light that eventually shines on your legacy but guides your solid image to reflect in a shared experience. It’s often difficult to discuss these issues openly, yet outlining your final wishes can bring a sense of calm. It’s not a subject that sits well, but it’s what defines you. It is what allows you to plant seeds that will provide a shade of care to your loved ones, after your demise.

The idea that anyone can help ensure a better future — one in which people work for their legacy with the time they have left and find an ever-lasting solution— **_For Suite Life, That Is Powerful._**

Suite Life is helping you be intentional about your legacy and cultivating a better future for those you love the most. So many spend much of their lives preparing for future goals like retirement. Although this should be a priority, you should also consider the legacy you’ll leave behind- financial, digital, and otherwise. Arguably the only thing more rewarding than working hard is the life you are perceiving after your retirement and leaving behind a legacy that will impact generations to come.
So The Question Is;

What Will **_Your Legacy_** Be?
