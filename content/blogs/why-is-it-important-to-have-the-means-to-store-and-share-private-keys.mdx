While we step into the spotlight in 2022, crypto-assets have rapidly become a hot topic of discussion. However, most people fail to understand how value gets transferred between different people and how to keep their valuable assets safe. It might be true that cryptocurrencies have put the control of finance back in our hands, but they also make us vulnerable to cybercrime. Keeping this in mind, it is critical to comprehend what private and public keys are, their impact, and how to safeguard your private keys from attack successfully.

## Difference Between Public and Private Keys

You must be aware that the term ‘crypto’ in cryptocurrencies represents cryptography. Simply put, cryptography is a process through which information is encoded or decoded. In fact, cryptography is considered an exclusive feature of blockchain technology that has the potential to remove third-party verification as well as human interference. For the blockchain network to approve a transaction, it executes encrypted mathematical equations by matching your private and public keys.

Private and public keys are an integral part of every cryptocurrency. They enable you to transfer and receive crypto coins without involving any third party for transaction validation. Using these keys, you can transfer your crypto coins anywhere and at any time. The private and public keys fit together like a key pair. But there is a lot more to know about these keys, and it is crucial to understand their basic differences.

**Private key:** It uses a ‘secret key’ to encrypt or decrypt a code. The private key is symmetric as the only key is shared or copied by another party for decrypting the
**Public Key:** Public key uses two keys; one is for encryption, and another is for decryption. It is used to validate the data using asymmetric encryption.

## The Private Key: The Key to Success

When you are willing to send or receive crypto tokens or make a purchase, you hand over your public key to the other party. This directs them to your wallet address and grants them virtual access to it. However, in order for the transaction to be completed, it must be digitally signed using the private key. To comprehend this more simply:

● Consider the private keys to be your digital signature.
● You use it to accept that you, the coins’ owner, authorize the transaction or deposit address or to produce a new public key.
● The transaction gets signed by the private key, which enables the recipient to receive the tokens with the use of public keys.
●The network of blockchain is programmed to confirm any transaction where private, and public keys match.

This implies that anyone owning your private keys can access all your funds. So, who would want to reveal their private keys?
Let us dig into some of the practical benefits of private key encryption.

**Security:** Longer private keys with incredible entropy or randomness are considered more secure from dictionary attacks or brute force.

**Suitable for encryption:** Several cryptographic methods use private key encryption for encrypting transmissions of data. They mainly share public key algorithms to share secret keys safely.

**Faster:** The encryption of symmetric keys is considered faster computationally compared to asymmetric encryption having private-public key pairs.

**_If you cannot own your private keys properly, you cannot own your cryptocurrencies._**

When you are all set to 'dip a toe into the world of crypto, you must know that you are essentially putting your dreams and hopes into someone else's hands. Leaving your digital assets on a crypto exchange or platform or in hot wallets means you are verily expecting a third party to take care of them. It is the freedom to entirely control your own funds that fuel the rise of cryptocurrencies. With $200 million and above worth of crypto hacked in 2017, preserving your private keys has never been so important.

## How to Keep the Private Keys Safe?

Creating and printing a paper wallet is one of the common ways through which you can secure your private keys. It is a cold wallet storage system that is immutable to cyber thefts. However, it puts so much value into something which you cannot recover when it is lost.

An offline storage device can be the safest place to store your private keys. The Secure Wallet is a combination of the best of cold and hot storage that offers unparalleled safety with the convenience and accessibility of a bank card. Although the wallet is not linked to the internet, you can interact with it wirelessly or remotely via the companion app. This makes you choose when and how to use the wallet and offers a source to recover your crypto or digital assets in case you misplace the device.

## The Key Takeaways

The usage of the public internet is constantly expanding for personal, government, and commercial communication, and so is the need for safely using encryption to safeguard those exchanges. The security of private keys for protecting that data is considered the foundation of upholding security in all kinds of communication.

The owners of cryptocurrency must store their private keys in the safest possible way because losing access or control to them may result in losing access to the crypto asset. You can store your private keys on an isolated computer having no network connections or in hard copies that are secured physically.

The option of “holding your own private keys” or believing in a custodian relies on your risk tolerance, philosophy, and a host of various other aspects. If you have your own private keys, you can opt to use newer HD wallets, which can do an excellent task of managing them, and do not forget that you should never share them. Also, if you opt for a custodial solution such as an exchange, then make sure that you go with a trustworthy and genuine company that prioritizes regulation and security.
