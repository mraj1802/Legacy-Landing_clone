In the matrix of a digitized world, Technology allows individuals to go beyond the boundaries now more than ever before. We are living through a period where technological advances are on a roller coaster ride, and it's so difficult to keep up. In any case, as all of this new tech sides and turns into a part of our regular routines, it's critical to pause and ask yourself, "Is this truly making my life simpler?"

Making things simpler isn’t just misjudged, but it’s nearly extinct. New innovation loves to flaunt new elements and capacities, which, as a general rule, are born with new complexities.

And keeping in mind that your own time is now consumed by various social media platforms, a bunch of communication channels, and the wide range of "facilities" tech has brought into your life. The pressure and tension felt in our bones considering at the enterprise level are altogether more stressful. Rather than simplifying life, the digitized era has made it more convoluted. That is not how it should function.

## Tech has lost its way

When it comes to social media, smart gadgets, smart TVs, and shrewd everything, we have millions of ways to connect with more individuals and more "content" than any time in recent memory. Yet, the invasion of innovation making its way into our lives has a drawback - - it is diverting us from getting the true essence of reality. Keep in mind, that we are “humans”, not characters or avatars.

Rather than paving the road of one’s digitized world in a smooth and simplified manner, innovation has turned into a steady round of need to feel superior.

Organizations are continuously attempting to outperform each other by packing into an ever-increasing extent and making the market more segregated, without truly pondering what is significant (genuinely, there's a smart gadget out there somewhere with 16 cameras installed in it).

This happens for the purpose of making sparkling headlines and creating “astonishing” images for the user's eyes. Making the most unique stuffed product basically promises you a space on the coming bullet point article, and it's a simple comparison that will say, "The previous product can do 102 things, however, this one outperforms it with 105. That improves it."

Smartphones are a great illustration of this. Consistently another model emerges with a couple of new elements (or highlights that the contender added the prior year), and over and over again, the media we breathe on daily basis and the market associated with it work effortlessly to make it a “medicine” that our existence need to survive.

The questions we should be asking ourselves are;

- Is it really worth it?
- Are those new elements truly making our lives less muddled?

The mirror side of the questions reflects itself on an organizational level, where its damages are beyond significant. The new technology pops up now and then, encouraging us to take care of an organization's concerns. In any case, carrying out new systems makes new issues — new reconciliations, new workarounds, and new tasks to prepare for in the coming days for everybody.

Deep down in our gut, we all know the answer. A mindless trap has been set upon us ages ago and we being “humans” are tangling the true meaning of life in it slowly, and slowly.

Maybe new innovation offers steady updates, but it surely and simply presents unique intricacies. Genuine worth and less complexity come when the new system creates a revolution that persists.

## Cementing legacy beyond reality

- What if there is less complexity in technological advances?
- What if technology incorporates with us and provides what we actually need?

In any case, there are easier methods for maintaining a feeling of peace and presence on the planet we reside on, by being more brilliant and sharper with our consumption of the digitized world. There are ways of controlling the digitized firehose with a spigot, and finally taking command of our digital world.

Instead of diving our digital avatar into a black hole of complexity, we should be focused on cementing our digital avatar in a simpler and smoother manner, which projects our legacy in its true perspective for future generations to come.

Whether you chose complexity or simplicity, let it make you more human. Innovation is intended to make our lives more satisfying and our work quicker, instead of making our lives more filled with pressure and our work more irritating. Find an opportunity to get what you need from your life, and that will be the time you'll be on your way to cementing your “digitized legacy” that is understandable, unique, and indestructible.
