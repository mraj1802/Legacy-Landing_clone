During the COVID-19 pandemic, our social media platforms and internet helped us connect with our loved ones, coworkers, and friends, associating with our collaborators, companions, friends, and family during outrageous isolation.

In any case, our digital way of life was filled with flaws. Yes, we could talk and see people, but that mere interaction felt far off and impersonal. Regardless of having each delivery application at the tips of our fingers, we missed heading outside, exploring the world, and encountering life to its fullest.

## Metaverse: Be Anything!

Yesterday, I had a get-together with friends at my place. As written in the stars, we couldn’t stop talking about work, and right after that, a few of us started to vent our frustrations on each other. It’s a drill that jogs on every time, nothing new.

But one thing that we all laughed at was;
I’ll be the next president of America!

Yes, that’s what my best friend quoted in the middle of half-chewed BBQ in my mouth, it fell out of my mouth, and that’s how hard I laughed. We all laughed, except he, he was serious.

He then quoted;
You. Yes, You. You can be the next president of America in the metaverse!
Wait, what? What did you say? Metaverse?
Yes, Metaverse, Google it. He replied.

All I heard was silence, nothing else. And then we all laughed and ignored whatever he uttered at that moment. But that word “metaverse” stung me like a “bee.”
A turning point, one might say, felt like I was stuck in a metaphor of a parallel universe where I could be the next president of America. Yes, I googled about the metaverse—a jaw-dropping concept to bits and bytes.

As **Anuj Jasani** quoted;
**_“The Metaverse is not magic, it is a new world created by aliens from planet Earth to give an infinite experience of the existing world.”_**

From the perspective of reality, envision a world that exists virtually, in which people work, live, shop, and connect with each other’s, and all this from the solace of their lounge chair in the actual world. This is known as the “metaverse.”

## The Partyverse is just getting started!

For the most part, "Metaverse" didn't turn into a household term until Facebook changed its corporate name to Meta in October 2021. Around then, the organization reported plans to burn through $10 billion over the following year on further enhancements to work out its vision of the metaverse. The speed with which it recently began making headlines is impressive. And the meaning of “metaverse” seems to expand daily as more recognizable brands and businesses start to incorporate it into their long-term plans.

While everyone from celebrities to global brands like Nike has gotten involved, Facebook is responsible for setting the metaverse buzz in motion.

For sure, the metaverse is viewed as a next gen-revolution to take over the internet, incorporating various forums, including gaming, online networks, and conferences where individuals team up utilizing a digitized avatar or facsimile of themselves. So it’s more about the same things we dive into daily, including social media, the internet, video games, and online shopping. This all rolled into one but more advance in nature.

## Horizons of Meta Worlds

Soon after, Meta’s first conceptual metaverse, the horizons of Meta worlds start to shape up, and anyone with a Meta headset or oculus can taste its vibe. Out of nowhere, they began to refer to this as “the metaverse.” But, there is more going on and many things you'll have to be aware of before asking yourself, Is this a new platform to invest in?

##### YES ∞.

Simply put, a metaverse is a universe within a universe, and the cycle continues. So, my frenzy NFTs have a limitless platform to sell, or I can purchase new ones. Who knows, your NFT will be hanged in the White house.

It opens new dimensions for NFTs and the whole concept of digital currencies. We will purchase digital files, digital products, virtual clothing, shoes, groceries, fuel, and other things you experience in the real world. The much buzz about the fungible and non-fungible token enables NFT-real-estate, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and open source to come to life.

## Meta Freedom

A basic Google search uncovers that various virtual land agencies now specialize in providing NFTs, land, currencies in decentral, and other metaverses. As its title would imply, Decentraland is decentralized, meaning that anybody can make anything in this virtual open sea.

Some entrepreneurs and organizations have additionally constructed their territories for events associated with NFTS art shows, meetings, or meetups. Suppose you can afford to run, host, or even sponsor part of an event. In that case, you can gain crypto revenue or awareness from users who are interested in the topic while also gaining attention for your product or service.

What is freedom if it has certain boundaries, right? In metaverse, you can potentially talk to various people at once while wearing your NFT clothes. That’s influencing your surroundings and community marketing at the same time and at the same time owning branded location (P.S. my eyes are already on owning the white house or becoming the new president of America), fashion trends, avatars, games, and so on. One can start with inbound sales to end it with personal networking of owning a business of B2C products.

## Is it worth diving in?

After mumbling-jumbling with state-of-the-art metaverse concept, here is what I gathered so far. As of today, the crowd of the metaverse is still in the developing phase, there's as yet a learning curve for users to learn, and a few brands and groups will not have the option to bear the cost of virtual world investments sooner rather than later.

Yet, it's essential and critical that the metaverse is getting both rejection and hype, as when Twitter and Facebook initiated their launch. In this present reality where innovation is rapidly advancing and improving, what's not available to all today will be involved by the vast majority later.

On the off chance that you're a well-renowned brand that can stand to face challenges and explore arising virtual universes, why not consider the marketing and business genres I discussed above, or in any event, make the team decide whether the metaverse is a commendable venture for you.

For other startups and individuals, it might take a while before you want to dive deep into the offering of various metaverses. But, it does not mean you should completely wipe it from your emerging trend radar.

Ultimately, the metaverse is vast, complex, and growing. And although I did my best to keep you up to date, you'll need to do some digging and understand your persona to know if investing time, money, NFTs, or crypto in it is right for you and your brand.
