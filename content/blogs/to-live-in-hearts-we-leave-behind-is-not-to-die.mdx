Death is the weirdest and most ordinary thing that can occur in day-to-day life. Beloved by some, and despised by others, a human, in biological terms of boundlessly complex awareness, ceases to exist; all the atoms organized in an unavoidably exceptional manner are now dispersed forever.

Someone we cherished so much has passed on. It very well may be difficult to tell where we go when we depart. For religions, kicking the bucket was viewed as a fundamental, immensely significant part of one’s existence. For some, death occurs at a time appointed by a higher power, and for others, simply by destiny.

## A Justice of Grief

Time can heal any wound, but the scars of grief last forever. We humans are and will press forward, under unobtrusive pressure, we draw curtains on our sorrows. It is in our nature that we keep moving, that we put things in context, that we comprehend what must be.

But, what is the point here? There is no such need for this. Getting over our “loss” is something we can’t get over. We will not, at any point, neglect or naively redeem ourselves and we don't need to. The continuous grief we endure is basically the cost we pay for having loved. At some point in our life, the memory of what has happened will hit us with its full crushing power, as though someone had just quietly whispered the news in our ears.

Conclusively, we have no option but to put it all behind us and we shouldn’t hope to take it all on our backs throughout the span of our life. Death has a consuming nature that can overshadow the existence of our loved ones and is very difficult to overcome. In this matter, love can be defined as eternal. Grieving doesn't have an endpoint. We must bear that this loss will never leave us.

## Spinning the wheel

When someone dies, it isn't the point at which their body fails to exist, but who’s life they touched last. Even after we “kick the bucket”, the wheels of legacy continue to spin. On this premise, they have an inherited legacy that is still left to live on.

In our current era, the grief of death is not confined by any boundaries and travels across seven seas in the blink of an eye via various social media platforms. We are cementing an eternal digitized image that tells half of the story, diminishing the true essence of your legacy. That’s how real our social media lives have become, disrupting the true meaning of life and death.

Millions of messages hover over our timeline every day and the individuals who are behind them, often don’t deserve the attention. It is just a montage of spiritual lows and highs, consumed by those who are addicted to social screens, feeding their inner devils.

## Enduring Legacy

We will live, and live tomorrow, and the following day, but we will never forget what they have done for us and how they made us feel. We endure their legacy. This isn't any disrespect or indelicacy. It is us being faithful to the legacy they left behind. We can live on yet be devoted to all that they implied for us. Nobody can isolate us from them. Yes, we miss them but they live on in us.

## A digitized seed oflegacy

The seed of legacy they planted continues to survive and grow within us. There are continuous conversations we have with them in our minds. The seed of legacy can be many things that have yet to occur. Carry out their will to secure their assets, distribute their wealth, and honor their wishes as they intended.

A constraint that is boundless of any boundaries, as someone is whispering their words into our ears, so clearly. As if they are the ones who are advising us on what to do. Death is certain, but so is legacy. It cannot be stolen, but it can be guided, allowing them to live inside us till eternity.
