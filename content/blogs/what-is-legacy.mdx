For many, it is the amount of money or property left to someone in a
will; for others, it is the set of beliefs and the richness of one’s
life, including what that person accomplished and the impact they had on
people and places.

In this frenzied world, we must leave something behind one day, by
choice or law. A guy who was living next door died last week. We used
tos play golf together. Winter morning, he was sitting on a chair having
a cup of coffee, already covering himself in a cozy blanket. The warmth
of a fire is soothing his feet, watching the snow which covered the
grass and plants of his lawn. AAHH, I would be willing to spend a
fortune to have a feel of it. At that moment, his body goes numb, and
the soul leaves his body. Again someone left something behind, the soul
whispered slowly to the body. This will happen to everyone one day; No
one can escape death; that is a fact.

- **So the question is was he prepared for that?**

I don’t know. Maybe Yes. Maybe No.

<br />
<br />

- **Should he be prepared for that?**

A 100% Yes.

<br />

Well, legacy can be drafted in two flows, unintentionally and intentionally. The first one is when you didn’t mean to be remembered but somehow you left a mark that was worth something, that’s an unintentional legacy. The second one is when you worked hard to build something for the ones you love or do something to left a mark on this world, that’s an intentional legacy.

Maybe I’ll leave a legacy. I realize I use that term, and I've seen others following the same steps. In any case, I keep thinking about whether it's something we ought to hold and place in the storage room.

###### **_For what reason do I say that?_**

"Leave a legacy" repeatedly links with the idea of estate planning. Also, in a frenzied way, only a few people fancy the idea of estate planning and find out about the path they are following — except estate planning attorneys. Be that as it may, I believe this builds up our propensity to tie "leaving a legacy" when it comes to leaving something behind. Also, with that thought, maybe it's too simple even to think, "After I'm gone, why does it make a difference? I'll let someone else sort it out."

So yes, it is true that we all leave something behind; some are good, some are bad. Nonetheless, it may sound unintentional to leave something behind. I'm dissatisfied to find I've left my mobile phone or my wallet back.

What if I contemplate a better expression which is to “live a legacy.” This expression better catches the idea of being dedicated to your legacy as it connects with the way we live our lives.

I believe it likewise catches the glimpse of representing things that will come in the future. As Soren Kierkegaard once said that connects us with this part of the legacy:

##### **_"Life can only be understood backward, but it must be lived forwards.”_**

Moving from one house to another, there is a constant blink of “what we are leaving behind” but most of us don’t even care when it comes to “what we are leaving behind when we die.” Maybe we envision what our obituaries will say regarding us. Or on the other hand, we consider the friends and family we will be leaving behind. Maybe we think about what they will talk about us once we are gone? What memories or images will they have of us?

## An Audacious way of legacy

There is only one way to live your life and that is forward. What's more, I believe "live a legacy" reaches to the perception of living now. Do we impart in our kids and grandkids a bunch of values to follow and, thusly, incorporate into generations to come? Isn’t the true meaning of legacy what we put in motion for the future?

What set of stories or memories should we pass on that can be shared starting from one generation and then onto the next? Should they be centric on ceremonies, rhythms, and customs that matter and can they actually continue with our generation cycles?

On the contrary who wouldn’t want their next generation to actually gather, singing the melody of the generations passed before them? Maybe they don't have the foggiest idea where it came from, yet they actually trust and follow it.

## Leave or Live

As the coronavirus pandemic sweeps through the globe, more people may find themselves in urgent need of a “will” in the declaration of their assets to their loved ones. Estate planning is a meaningful and everlasting gift you can give your family. And setting up a smooth inheritance isn't as hard as you think.

I was reading an article on Covid-19 when I saw an astonishing stat. Lawyers in Europe and US outlined a surge of 64% with their previous and new clients to update and create wills, including their estate plans during the waves of pandemics. The internet searches also reported the same surge in searches connected with estate plans and wills. In context, Coronavirus can be considered a positive impact on our society because now more people are worried about their estate plans and wills compared to the past. I’m confident that many people, including myself, have invested more energy contemplating their mortality since the virus hit the airwaves.

The point here is, “was Covid-19 necessary to wake us up and make us more aware of what we are leaving behind?” If the answer is yes, then why can’t we see death? I know I will die one day too, and at some point, so will everyone else. Do we need alarms to remind us now and then? **Haaah**.

The same survey highlighted that about 22% don’t have a will, and surprisingly they mentioned that they do not want to have one. Interestingly, around one in ten believes creating a “will” would be a tempting fate. Wow. So most people around the globe want their will to be shared in a standard way, as mentioned in their respective state laws after their death. This scenario will not suit a person with a complex family structure where half or step-siblings are present.

Still, if that guy doesn’t have a complex family system, it is highly possible that he doesn’t have social and subscription accounts spread like an ocean, including Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Spotify, Netflix, amazon prime, and so on. Maybe the guy “swore an oath” not to create a profile on these platforms; there’s a possibility. People do that, considering these platforms as illusions and being envious of things, relationships, and lifestyles that don’t even exist. For me this guy is a true gentleman living his life with a set of traditional beliefs, but and it’s a big but

- Do those sets of traditional beliefs stop him from building his legacy?
- Do those beliefs stop him to leave something for his loved ones?
- Do those beliefs stop him to write down his final wishes?

<br />

At the same time, his estate may include houses, lands, farms, businesses, shops, factories, etc.; for that, he may value traditional wills, but what about the other guy whose set of beliefs or assets lies within the digital world?

Yes, it can be his Facebook account where he met the love of his life or an NFT which has been worth millions or a couple of BTC in a digital wallet. Of course, I’m talking about his whole digital life. Did he ever consider what happens to his digital assets and accounts when his soul leaves his body?

- Wouldn’t he want the love of his life to have his accounts after he is gone?
- Wouldn’t he want that his digital assets should be distributed among his loved ones as he wanted?
- Wouldn’t he want his digital affairs settled down before his demise?

<br />

So my questions would be:

- Are you living the legacy for the next generation?

**&**

- Are you leaving the legacy for the next generation?

**OR**

- What if you can have both?

Yes, 7 billion sets of beliefs and one solution, Legacy Suite.
