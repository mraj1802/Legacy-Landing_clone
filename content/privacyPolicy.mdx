<h2> 2. NON-PERSONALLYIDENTIFYING INFORMATION </h2>

<h3 id = "users-of-the-sites-generally"> 2.1 Users of the Sites Generally </h3>

“Non-Personally-Identifying Information” is information that, without the aid of additional
information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person.“Personally-Identifying
Information,” by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can
be directly associated with a specific person.

Like most Sites operators, we gather from users of the Sites Non-Personally-Identifying
Information of the sort that Web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available.

That information includes the user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser
type, and the locations of the Sites the user views right before arriving, while navigating, and
immediately after leaving the Sites.

Although such information is not Personally-Identifying Information, it may be possible for the Sites
to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location
of the visitor’s point of connectivity as well as other statistical usage data. 

Company analyzes Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Sites to
help Company better understand how the Sites are being used, by identifying patterns and trends
in usage, both in terms of content and ease of use.

<h3 id = "usage-data"> 2.2 Usage Data </h3>

We may also collect information on how the Sites are accessed and used ("Usage Data").

This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g.,
IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Sites that you visit, the time and
date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic
data.

<h3 id = "web-cookies"> 2.3 Web Cookies </h3>

A “Web Cookie” is a string of information that assigns you a unique identification that Sites store
on a user’s computer and that the user’s browser provides to the Sites each time the user submits
a query to the Sites.

We use cookies on the Sites to track your visited pages, record your user preferences, and
facilitate purchase procedures. Company also uses Web Cookies to track the pages that users
visit during each session, both to help Company improve users’ experiences and to help Company
understand how the Sites are being used.

COMPANY USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR
COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE
ACCESSING THE SITES, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE
SITES MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. USERS

SITES AND TO PROVIDE A CUSTOMIZABLE USER EXPERIENCE (BASED ON THE
USERS’ PREFERENCES).**

<h3 id = "web-beacons"> 2.4 Web Beacons </h3>

A “Web Beacon” is an object embedded in a web page or email that is usually invisible to the user
and allows us to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page or an email. Company
may use Web Beacons on the Sites and emails to count users who have visited particular pages,
viewed emails, and delivered co-branded services.

Web Beacons are not used to access users’ Personally-Identifying Information. They are a
technique the Company may use to compile aggregated statistics about Sites’ usage. Web
Beacons collect only a limited set of information, including a Web Cookie number, time and date
of a page or email view, and a description of the page or email on which the Web Beacon resides.

You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all
Web Cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a Web Cookie is tendered,
permitting you to accept or decline Web Cookies individually.
